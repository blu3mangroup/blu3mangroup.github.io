- create the short and long directories under _posts
- add an assets directory, with an img folder > within this folder you can specify your own welcome image as "welcome.png" and an icon as favicon.png
- download and run the tag_generator.py script at the root directory to generate a tags folder with tags, this has to be done each time you add new posts or tags to the site for search tag functionality to be up to date

- you will need an index.html in the root to serve as welcome page
- 

index.md as opposed to index.html? I want to have the pages set specifically too, really, less flexibility and ability to add pages. it seems like rather than building a jekyll "theme" I've had my thinking oriented around building a site, since there is little decor or styling done. Maybe I could rework this later and make it into more of a robust and proper theme. for now i will just have to fork or clone.
