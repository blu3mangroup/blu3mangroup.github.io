### Sino-Tex Renewable Array // [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/25/texas-chinese-wind-farm-national-security-espionage-electrical-grid/)

We have more news about China. They have decided to buy ranches in Texas, and build windmills on it. Well, a certain firm and businessman, naturally tethered to the governing body of the rice-consuming state, has done it. The headline of this "foreign policy" article makes this sound very interesting, but it is simply a whole load of speculation and political sound bits with fast and tight orbits about a general fear of Chinese money. Hey - I don't blame them, but for the time I spent slogging through this we wanted some insight and not a 2 decade surface scan mixtape of wind farm and china controversy. 

> “Would they be able to manipulate the industrial control systems on their side? Obviously, because they would they would own that,” said Hurd. “Is there a way that by being connected to our electrical grid, that you would be able to overload that grid?” 

Much opposition to the development mimics perennial wind-woes, but more interestingly is the idea of it being part of a Chinese covert attack strategy or economy subverter. The potential for cameras to be mounted atop the turbines and aimed at a nearby military base aside, the prime worry is the interruption of training flight paths. More interestingly, possibilities stemming from a Chinese controlled contribution to the power grid.

> Even more puzzling, the business case for the new venture didn’t make much sense to Kwast and local officials. How would the property—which lawmakers and county advocates say is in the middle of nowhere and did not have significant road access at the time—be able to turn a profit?

When it comes to the "tech" sector, the cheap/fast carriage of data, remote and flexible control of ubiquitous devices and outwardly attractive services capable of information collection, distortion, propagation and distraction perhaps intuitively warrant a reasonable degree of oversight. When it comes to power I am completely lost. In my mind, I doubt China will be shipping over bespoke trojan backdoored turbines let alone a staff of nationals to maintain and operate them. What is the nature of a wind turbine, and a farm of them? Is the land cheap in Texas, and would they be a good use of the land?
