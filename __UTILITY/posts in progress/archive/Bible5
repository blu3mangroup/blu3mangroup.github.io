## "Let's Play The Bible: Deuteronomy 1-34"

![Manuscript of the Septuagint](/assets/img/deutscript.jpg)

### Preface

Ok, here we go. Deuteronomy, this is the last entry in the fabled "pentateuch" - the sequence of five books authored directly or indirectly by Moses. While I'm reading this as part of the KJV Bible, you'll find those five books in the jewish Torah. It's worth mentioning that the shared origins of judaism and Christianity don't stop there, [as the broader OT and the broader Tanakh (writings pertinent to judaism beyond the core Torah) share many more books, with some important distinctions](https://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/tools/bible-basics/what-is-the-difference-between-the-old-testament-the-tanakh-and-the-hebrew-bible) in order, canon (some inclusions in the OT [are considered "apocrypha"](https://www.christianity.com/wiki/bible/what-is-the-apocrypha-are-apocryphal-books-really-scripture.html) by jews), translation and even punctuation.

After falling behind variously in completing posts and completing reading of books, my notes are largely taken from one prolonged sitting. While for me this means easier mental movement and exploration within the book, my notes and writing will probably remain as superficial and near-frantic as ever. I wanted to do a straightforward live blogging of reading, stopping to make notes and form sections to investigate as necessary, but the quantity and variation in quality of my notes leads me to proceed as usual, trying to sculpt some discrete sections out of the most interesting notes and avoid simple regurgitation. Pretty sad to renege on the interesting idea, we are going to though.

### Debriefing

![Tell Your Children](/assets/img/mosesremember.jpg)

So what's basically happening in this book is the tribes of Israel have been through a long journey toward a seizure of the "promised land" of Canaan, and Moses will spend his dwindling years restating and giving a moratorium on various matters with regard to religious law. He's putting a bow on it. [It's translated original title - "These are the words", is appearing in mistranslated form - "repetition of the law"](https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/) - commonly, but this is nevertheless very accurate in meaning.

After these events much of the direct and descriptive teachings from God in antiquity have been conveyed and his covenant is all but officially honoured, and Moses can now pass leadership to Joshua (the proceeding book of "Joshua" is eponymous) so he can begin to conquest the promised land served up to him. We are not covering that next book now of course, but it's good to contextualize what is otherwise a rather arrhythmic and clinical text. Moses will also leave us with a song. Some poorly arranged summaries of topics covered in the book are as follows:

- **Preamble:** The pause that this book provides is first hedged in the timeline thus far.
- **The Covenant:** God will cover the fulfilling of his covenant with the people, and their ancestors (Noah, Abraham etc) before them, where we hear various stipulations in the brokered deal. 
- **Governance:** There's talk of the pending conquering of Canaan and in that of course is how the territory will be governed. This ranges from the overall tribe leadership to elders for specific regions.
- **Review:** Interspersed in the book is review of the various curses and blessings on the people of Israel, their purpose and things we can learn from them.
- **Death of Moses:** Moses performs a song for us and the plan for Joshua to take over leadership is instituted. He then passes away on a mountain.

### Conquest Mode

"contend with him in battle"

"utterly destroying the men women and children of every city" - these guys are cut from the muslim cloth of 

Og the giant and his bedstead of iron

leavened bread? why have i been ignoring this strange phrase?

### iPads

the tablets of stone are given in this chapter

### Second Opinion?

circumcize the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked?

circumcize the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked?

### Judaism Detection

sihon - zion

write them upon the signpost/door of your house - that jewish little box thing containing commandments?

bring together the "peculiar people" as a strong group. 

### More

leavened bread? why have i been ignoring this strange phrase?

"Neither shalt thou set thee up any image which the lord thy God hateth."

he shall not multiply horses to himself

I will raise them up a prophet from among thier brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

but the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. 

Hwo shall we know?

when a prophet speakth in the name of the lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet has presumtuously: be not afraid of that guy.

___

God speaks about splitting up three cities of decent distance, for nature of diversifying the investment and allowing for the benefit of sovereign interactions. Balkanization is king - at least in order to provide some leeway in some touchier avenger of the blood scenarios. If the scenario is concrete - the elders need to help enforce the law, delivering the slayer to the avenger for slaying.

this couples with a need for multiuple witnesses - one witness will bring about nothing. its much like a modern court.

"life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."

___
in discussion of later wars, a slightly contradictory command is given to spare women and children of besieged cities - that they might be taken as slaves. The cattle is again spared 

___

treehugging

- God says that even in besieging a city you should not cut down trees that are within their yield catchment range, nor to make use of them for weapons- "for the tree of the field is man's life" - except "trees not for meat"

a heifer? with regard to elders jurisdiction over the deceased victim. which precinct?? 21

againt - parents with a stubborn, rebellious, gluttonous and drunkard son are to bring him to the elders where he will then be stoned at the city gate

PUT EVIL AWAY FROM AMONG YOU

the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god

divers seeds? diverse seeds? vineyards a mess?

thou shalt not wear a garment of diverse sorts, as of woollen and linen together

you can eat your neighbours grapes and corn as long as you don't utilize tools of business/scale to collect. only one sittings worth please. thats a bit interesting.

____
sins of the fathers

The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

Emerods?

__
And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her hcildren which she shall bear, for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in they gates.

being plucked from the land and scattered to lands which worship other Gods, lands where you will find no ease and the sole of your foot will find no wrest. a trembling heart and failing of eyes. sorrow of mind.

moses seems to be passing the mantle onto joshua now. proclaiming his 120 years of age as nearing time for retirement, and at least less intensive travelling to spake unto those people which he leads which who have prospered now across long ranges and Jordan

deuterononmy 33 is fuckin crazy. sounds like a big final exposition a big final speech by moses, he's running along with it

So moses dies gazing over the lands which God promised his fathers fathers in the great covenant. he's then buried in a valley in the land of moab, over against beth-peor. no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day - and a prophet like him has not arisen since (at time of writing, the book - not this post). joshua shall be the leader in moses' stead however. now its his book next, and why is it not in the big five? is it considered lesser? i suppose since moses is God bearing prophet it is of lesser importance in a way.

### Closing the Book
