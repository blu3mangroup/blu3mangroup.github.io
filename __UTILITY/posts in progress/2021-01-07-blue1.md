## Notes to Pro-Lapse To

I'm making a new series of content vestibules to deliver time-lapse footages of various kinds, interspliced with fun things a unique take on a popular genre. inspired by what?

## Cinema

### The Intro
How make the intro and outro

- massive rotary overlay and alternating render cycles to coverup the failure of photorealism
- different time attack references, time references, gonna die soon
- textuals overlays, bubbles of incoming prolapse subjects
- fred dibnah cigarette flick

### In Vitro

chronolapse. make sure to edit out incriminating text and try to decouple any sense of duration where necessary lol

sidebars

cd disk case salvage from othership and re-use for effecting the cover.. three hours later (because i stopped chonorlapsing for the main creation phase of a final draft smh)

quadrant view? for when dual monitors necessary, or other similar framings to get other bits of screen some airtime.

### Repacking the Pro-Lapse

How to makei t better, more fun klaus esque things

The intro for 2022 will be a sand egg timers.
