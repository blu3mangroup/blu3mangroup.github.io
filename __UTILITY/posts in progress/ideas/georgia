trump is a retard but i like him

reuters disingenuous reporting - fine, expected - fact check disingenuous? awesome guys

look into tabulated totals official figures first - why cite a calculation method, is estimate by the nonprofit? 

lower across the board - thats every state, battle ground or not, red team or blue team

pretty interesting stuff that gets unfortunately sandblasted into oblivion

something something people who normally voted in person and going mail-in are smart and good at handwriting/checking boxes and so on. lol

the kind of thing that makes a heart sink to see, on most level. thats a bit melodramatic however - very cool

maybe interesting to look in at rate changes from 2016 to 2018, theres some big gulfs there too - and earlier results, where are those? pretty cool, too much a job that i dont care to do however, so maybe just one state probably georgia 

check out michigan - very strangely consistent with past years despite continued status as a trophy ultra-boost state. official figures are given there, as of jan '21 as i tap in these notes very interesting
