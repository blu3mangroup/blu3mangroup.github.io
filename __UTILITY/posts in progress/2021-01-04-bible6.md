_____________live notes

So joshua will lead in moses' stead, correct?

Joshua. son of nun? does this have anytihng to do with nuns?

just as God had said, there is further land, inspected on command of Joshua, that is ready for the taking and to prosper into - Jericho 

stones of signifying the river jhordan cut off for passage of the ark

a second cicrumcision?? at the hill of the circumcisions?? What and why? that's a little bit interesting and unusual

A man accosts joshua, bearing a sword. the man claims to be "captain of the hose of the lord" and told him to lose his shoes. so that's possibly a thief, realistically - but something must have moved Joshua to be convinced.

joshua is gathering some fame and renown for conquesting this city and tooting trumpets. his conquest of lands lasts not too long though. as he is forsaken by the Lord - there are sinners amongst the Israelites and the rubble - achan admits to his sin, having stolen gold and silver and coveted it amongst his posessions. he is stoned with all of his family, in valley of achor

I'm seeing some references to Beth-El here, which sounds familiar - like bethlehem?

theres lots of piles of stones being made to stand as testament - cairns placed here

"edge of the sword" and God's spear pointing

gilgal - gallile?

more lands and more are conquered, until joshua grows old - and still there are more conquests to be had.

REMNANT OF THE GIANTS

WHAT IS THE INHERITANCE? what god promised and is in process of giving now, via luck laden conquest? i thought they already took the land of canaan for their own? or perhaps just made headway.

the lord god of israel was their inheritance re:levites - im still not following exactly what this means

this is the most unbelievably detailed/long stock-check yet, there are reams of cities, locations and villages named, along with some delineation of who should inherit them and more.

it seems these conquests are all in order to procure an inherited land within canaan for each tribe. maybe i sohuld have picked up on that earlier?

my god there is a shit-ton of this divvying out of suburbs and wildernesses to tribes and chilren of elders

Why exactly is this not in the pentateuch anyway - Are they special - specialer than the septuagint? i have to wonder if they knew something about joshua lack of holy touch because he still seems to be cited as convincingly carrying the mantle....

as joshua grows further in years and age he gathers the people to retell of the covenant and God's kept promises, from flood to canaan. warning gravely to not return to the savage ways of old
