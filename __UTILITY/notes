The log-flow I find myself following results in these steps to be automated:

1) Post is written up by user, frontmattered and stored appropriately within jekyll files.

2) Desired contents (images) are named by user as referred to in posts, and placed into a folder "_imgstage" for processing.

3) Image stage is begun, which optimizes and resizes (w=360px) the images for the site:

     - SVG are already fine and are sent to the assets folder.

     - Animated (presumably) GIF are optimized via gifsicle.

     - All other images types have any alpha channels replaced with white bg layer, and compressed to jpg via xnview. 

4) Tags are generated by running tag_generator.py 

    >python tag_generator.py

5) SASS processes a CSS file, ejected as sassed4md.css for preview purposes.

6) The site is hosted locally for review.

    >bundle exec jekyll serve
