Some considerations when using this website design:

Due to the way the jekyll or kramdown works/wraps images, it seems the only way to achieve the correct image-centered post style is to manually include and enclose them like this within the post:

    {:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
    ![Hover text.](/assets/img/yourimage.jpg)
    {}: refdef}
