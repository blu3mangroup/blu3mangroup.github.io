### Listserv // [Listserve Cowboy](https://blog.mail-list.com/what-is-a-listserv/)

What is a "Listserv" and why have I had an article about the subject open in a browser tab for perhaps weeks? The home page of an [apparent espouser of listservs](https://blog.mail-list.com/) seems to indicate it is probably some discontent with social media that lead me here. My initial guess is this is in the realm of [BBS](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/bulletin-board-system-BBS), [RSS](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/) or other social/news feeding and communing tool of yesteryear, but maybe its just a fancy term for a mailing list. Sounds quite vague, and this vagueness coupled with the early-tech-cool styling from the omitted end "e" serv as the only direction for the aforementioned guessing.

In the explainer article from the espouser we're told that it a kind of super-set of the "mailing list" application of e-mail. Where a mailing list is simply a collation of e-mail addresses, or the principle function of utilizing these batches of e-mail addresses, a listserv is a software solution that manages members/subscription, administration, archival, filtering and delivery of e-mails in a way that allows creation of large [discussion groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list#Discussion_list), going beyond "reply all" CC e-mail chains but [still living and breathing autonomously on an e-mail spine](https://www.lsoft.com/manuals/16.0/htmlhelp/list%20subscribers/AboutMailingLists.html). 

While the term ["listserv" is a trademarked name](https://wiki.list.org/DOC/Mailman%20is%20not%20Listserv) dating back to the original software, which pre-dates the internet as we know it, it is often generally used to label solutions as described above. To focus in on some interesting fundamentals, we must take [MailMan](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html) as an example rather than an [easy-use replica service](https://gaggle.email/) or [packaged commercial solution](http://www.lsoft.com/). MailMan is a free and open [GNU-Project](http://www.gnu.org/) aligned software that is coded using [Python](https://www.python.org/), we can do this on linux. I am not going to do it - I am [instead imagining](https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node4.html) I am [doing it](https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node9.html).

![MailMan Interface](/assets/img/mailman.png)

The software aside, you must have a web server and mail server set up on the machine. Mailman will be hooked up to these, working some magic and then relaying mail using the mail server. The [web server provides an interface](https://lists.gnu.org/) for administration and [a gateway to present lists and archives](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/) in the browser. It can do "VERP" (variable envelope return path) delivery, where messages are crafted specifically for recipient - very interesting. There's really not much more to it than that, I believe. I should instead look into [SMTP or something](https://whatismyipaddress.com/smtp) even more pure, some time. I have now wrote four paragraphs about mailing lists.
