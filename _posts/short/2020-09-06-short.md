I don't like to exert much effort [on Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_law), there's a necessity of rest and enjoyment on this day, the day after the sixth. I still feel compelled to post though. Once I'm through with my little seven day minimum marathon of serial posts here, I have a list of things I need to attend to with regard to my blog here. They're as follows:

- The tag browsing page will not scroll on my desktop browser. Perhaps I should re-arrange it completely.
- The site behaves in some odd ways on mobile, specifically a different in the size of the page drawn between index pages and post-specific pages.
- I need to script the generation of a post template, so I'm not copy pasting/preparing one by hand like a moron.
- I need to script an image conversion/resize/compress process so I'm not doing it all manually.

Some more contemplative tasks have cropped up in my mind, that go along with this:

- I need to consolidate the tags and consider the current tagging system, I'm being completely ignorant of precedent/existing tags and optimization of browsing.
- Think about ways to include GLSL experiments and the like in posts, via embed.
- Actually post a longform article.

I've collated these into a github "project" associated with the repository, so they're there for posterity, since I tend to simply forget what I write in these posts, and don't really look over them. 

### Loreen // [Lorine Zineb Noka Talhaoui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen_(singer))

Loreen won eurovision for Sweden (home of [The Knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knife)) in 2012. It's the only eurovision I ever watched, and people think her song (written by [a guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_G:son) who goes by G:son rather than Gustafsson, very cool) was the best ever. I liked it a lot. The song has that melodramatic kind of feeling a lot of dance tunes popular on the radio always have, but they pull it off really well. She performed it live [last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvUtH4TC7tY) and put some really cool new inflections on her vocals during parts of the song. I found myself listening to it after tumbling through various eurodance tracks of the millenium zone. She's still very popular and prolific, but obviously not very popular outside of Europe. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhD6866ROXU) performance was pretty cool too, she remains stationary (1:16) as the camera cuts to different frames, which probably doesn't play well for the in-person audience.

### Adobe Stock Advertisement // [Keith Rankin](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/keith-rankin-found-in-adobe-stock-illustration-171019)

For some reason I'm signed up to a bandcamp release notification for ["Orange Milk Records"](https://orangemilkrecords.bandcamp.com/) and the artwork for [one of their latest releases](https://orangemilkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/drop-shadow) caught my eye. It was made by the label's owner(?) [Keith Rankin](http://www.keithrankinart.com/). Pretty interesting set-up, it's almost like the label acts as an elaborate venue/muse for his visual work or plays an important role in the musical artists or music (he's a musician himself) it attracts.

The work has a great print and retro feel to it, the colour palettes are often vivid and the shading is simplified to near clip art levels. There's lots of pieces composed abstractly and lots of negative space that make things surreal. It would be ignorant and reductive to conjure up the word "vaporwave" to use as an adjective, but in some places it (unfortunately) fits, with the wealth of retro contrivances such as Spheres, Busts/Disembodied heads and even a [Utah Teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot). Lots of them look like they could be made for [Pink Floyd albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Division_Bell), or some other popular psychedelia [manufacturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currents_(Tame_Impala_album)). Actually these look a lot like [Salvador Dali](https://www.dalipaintings.com/) stuff, like a lot.

The piece I that caught my eye the most was actually created for an article (linked above in the title) that is a de-facto Adobe Stock advertisement. Using what might be described as a "photo-bashing", he works around/with some selected stock images to create the artwork. I don't know if this is what he does every time, but if it is I'm almost certain he wouldn't restrict himself to Adobe Stock and I wouldn't be surprised if he'd never used Adobe Stock before this whole event.

>“It’s basically like a Google search engine with an entirely different set of results,” he tells It’s Nice That.

That is his take-away on the topic of Adobe Stock. I read it as confirmation that he's just using Adobe Stock in place of the wide array of less expensive options someone might normally use to acquire references.

>All creative people have different ways of gathering research. Whether it’s a poke around the local library, a thoughtful visit to an art gallery, or a beautifully annotated sketchbook; individual creatives record meaningful information in a way that makes sense to them. For the illustrator Keith Rankin however, he finds the best way to gather research is through a mammoth digital folder where he can save as many images as he likes from the internet.

I can relate to this, but can't everyone? I love hoarding images, video and all manner of other assets/inspiration to look at and use whenever, but I can't help but feel the article writer is doing my man a disservice by asking about/highlighting this common habit instead of getting a cooler anecdote out of him. No one is going to take a thoughtful visit to an art gallery for a quick inspiration boost, right? Maybe a visit for it's own sake would lead to inspiration, whatever. The writer has all manner of identity politicking articles to her name, that's plenty circumstantial evidence for my hackery allegations. What a WASTE!!!

This whole thing kind of reminds me of [Rhythm Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvAICitZLUA) from Mass Appeal, where you get to see producers make tracks/beats with a selection of random records. Those are similarly insightful into a work process. Mr. Rankin has some [work videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GWJjtVsbYA) upload to the net by himself that provide more insight. This guy is capital G great.

### Esperanto // [Universala Esperanto-Asocio](https://uea.org/)

I honestly can't believe I've never heard of this. A constructed language with worldwide vision, it was initiated by a pole called Zamenhof. I'm almost certain I have heard of the name before (esperanto that is) but maybe it's getting tangled up in my brain and accessing registers for words like ["esprit"](https://www.lotusespritturbo.com/) or "especially". It has up to two million speakers world wide, and there's even a subset of native speakers.

The fact there are any native speakers for this auxiliary language at all is interesting because it does not appear on googling to have any pseudo-country or culture to which it is endemic in some way. It's also interesting because it backs up the idea that this thing is a cult, which descended upon my brain after reading about it for ten minutes max. I have to imagine these native Esperanto kids quickly learned a second, actually native, language, after their [Star Trek](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/10/05/star-trek-economics-is-just-true-communism-arriving/#5da155dcef64) utopic one-world borders-are-imaginary green party voting visionary empathic high IQ altruist righteous parents forced it on them for possibly ideological reasons.

>Zamenhof's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster world peace and international understanding, and to build a "community of speakers", as he believed that one could not have a language without such a community.

I won't go on, I'm not one of those weird autistic polyglot lexical lovers, but it is pretty interesting. I'm too low functioning to desire anything but a surface skim. I just found it funny how cult-like the whole thing seemed, especially when you read about the criticisms of Esperanto that stem from languages tethers to culture (something Esperanto could never realistically incubate).
