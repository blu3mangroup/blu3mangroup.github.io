### Time Keeping // [Toggl](https://toggl.com/)

![Boosted](/assets/img/boosted.png)

En route to bettering ourselves, we need to be very aware of our time-spending habits and attention supply. While not keeping tabs on tasks distinctly from tracking time spent on them, I did task+time both on the app ["Boosted"](https://www.boostedproductivity.com/), and before that ["Forest"](https://www.forestapp.cc/). I had to switch for a few reasons. I went from "Forest", an application that probably works on the web (edit: looks like it is also phonly), where you plant trees and they grow with [pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) or other time-unit spending, to a less gimmicky and more robust-feeling one in Boosted, which I spent probably 1.5 years using with varying dedication. Boosted let me export all of my [timekeeping data in CSV form](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba), so kudos to them for this freedom that I probably didn't consider before moving in and even paying premium charge.

There is a borderline absurd cottage industry of ["productivity guru"](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) talking-head wearing-jawbone types, [hobbyist/obsessive task-listers](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/), real-life [infomercial recipe noters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Poepoh1b_3k) orbiting kitchen islanders and after-market plugin/app makers offering [time tracking solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7zvPrmSodk) on software suite or tools that already exist - all centered on what amounts to putting text and keeping spreadsheets on computer. To make matters worse, this "sector" of the computer-user E-conomy is near perfectly balanced in its appeal/demand across [enterprise/business](https://www.clicktime.com/enterprise-timesheets) and [personal use](https://habitica.com/static/home). Luckily for me I recently changed out of the "Google Workspace" area and into Micro$oft realm, where their ["To-Do"](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) and "OneNote" tools gave me some direction or foundation alongside the cloud space I ordered. That is to say I had very little direction, since even looking into ["Power Apps"/"Flow"](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/) - and third-party google-result flooding [automate/integrate services like Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/microsoft-todo/integrations) - to at least automate task/project-creation as a backbone I couldn't find any straightforward time-integration, and the request for direct time-track implementation into "To-Do" is, [despite community backing, unnoticed after years](https://todo.uservoice.com/forums/597175-feature-suggestions/suggestions/35090644-integrate-pomodoro-functionality). It's fine, I enjoy having control over tool federation, you can tell by my decision to rely entirely on Microsoft outside of a timekeeping widget.

I should make note of some of the various tools (both task/productivity and/or timekeeping) for posterity, and there are some pretty nice looking ones that I almost went with:

- [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/): This thing is a bit radical, and really would take the place of To-Do rather than timekeeping. It even has its own weird syntax for summoning document structure pieces into the "pages" which you can nest and list in a sort of folder hierarchy. This is too much - at some point you are creating your own intranet workspace using their peculiar tools, instead of having task and time solution.

- [**WorkingHours**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/workinghours-time-tracking-timesheet/9mv51b301wfd?activetab=pivot:overviewtab): This one is put together by one man, and while it would be nice to support a singular maker and enjoy their singular vision, the "outlook/calendar integration" I imagined it would have was not existing. This didn't matter in the end, but I had already passed on it.

- [**FocusToDo**](https://www.focustodo.cn/): This one looks quite nice, dramatically cross platform and offers some kind of pomodoro centric approach. This one seems to be originally Chinese however. Do not download it.

- [**tmetric**](https://tmetric.com/integrations/microsoft-to-do-time-tracking): Offering what seems to me to be To-Do integration, this one will offer, when on a PC, using the browser extension and interacting with To-Do via the web-app, some overlayed links/buttons that I guess will start your time and generate "projects" or labels for time blocks based on where the starter button was overlayed. Flimsy.

- [**PomoDoneApp**](https://pomodoneapp.com/pomodoro-timer-for-microsoft-to-do.html): This one claims to have fully fledged To-Do integration, which is worth noting - but at this point I was past obsessively lusting for integration, so the poorly reviewed phone app turned me off.

In the end I resolved to remain using [Microsoft 365 tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365) alongside time-keeper of choice "Toggl". The toggle with no e app is simple and flexible. Looking back it would be over-complicated to time-track every step of tasks and goals as recorded and noted in To-Do, I enjoy a broad overview and active-use instead of whole hog integration and automation. The tool is really perfect and great - while seemingly designed as a more "enterprise" solution, the free plan works great for personal use, [you can import and export data in simple CSV form](https://support.toggl.com/en/collections/1148668-import-export) (might need to edit it slightly in spreadsheet editor), there's an app available on every platform and the report/graph to analyse your activity is okay. I've spent 24 minutes putting together this web log post so far. I went back and threw together a list of other tools I saw, now I'm clocking in at 1 hour 4 minutes. Now I am approaching 1 hour 4 minutes 33 seconds.
