### Video Printing // [Kurz Gesagt](https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell/videos)

![Infographic](/assets/img/infog.jpg)

Some videos by "Kurz Gesagt" - literal translation "Told Short" - are one of a vast array of cancers to be found attached to recommended videos lists, mine at least, on Youtube. This is besides my point however, because I am not really interested in talking about their clips, rather the ones they remind me of. The videos I want to discuss briefly are coming under the channel name ["the infographics show"](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheInfographicsShow). Their videos are all 5-15 minutes long, fully animated (insofar as some vector graphics with slight movement is "animated") with some fairly detailed graphics and, notable above all else, they upload these things at quite a clip - one daily with little modulation.

The [fearsomely prolific output](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fords-assembly-line-starts-rolling) coupled with the somewhat odd but discovery-channel or [Quora](https://www.quora.com/If-Hitler-had-Quora-what-questions-would-he-ask) realm subjects ("Why Life on the International Space Station Sucks" and "How Pablo Escobar Spent his Billions) conjures up thoughts of Chinese robots and Indians churning out [strange content designed for children](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Elsagate) to accumulate ad-revenue or all those web pages that litter search engine results that appear to be reconstituting data scraped elsewhere. The difference is that these have some decent production quality, and are very watchable. Without looking into it, it seems to me very possible there are simply multiple "studios" or pseudo-employees - maybe even external companies specializing in stock vector art - piecing together these animations, and some [poor sod on fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/categories/music-audio/voice-overs) fills his days narrating them for a very low rate.

With 10 million subscribers, a content-algorithm informed by habits of the reading-averse and the at least vaguely curious nature of man leveraging your operation, the output as it currently stands, wherever the starting point might have been, could be accomplished in an infinite number of ways. To be honest it is worrisome to consider that it wouldn't be far from feasible to [put together a machine that could direct and produce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQ0Obi14rM) these films, by trawling old copies of Nat Geo or parsing wikipedia pages before faxing a script to a voice actor, and consulting one of many vector art catalogues by tags.

According to the [official website](https://www.theinfographicsshow.com/), there does indeed appear to be a farm of freelancers generating the things. Indeed, on the home page he drops a request for any help, with a big fat contact button. Maybe I should apply for some work from this guy, I wonder how much he pays? Well, given the dearth of personal information on-site where the typing implies a singular I am still skeptical there is a human behind this. According to "wikitubia", a wiki providing a decent amount of qualitative information on youtube channels, tells that they even do clips in which the script-writer (the script being the only thing about this operation that appears remotely human) undergoes a challenge. Once again however, these are devoid of any human faces.

In fact, we hear of [further](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8JfkMtNAp44vmzdtnL4wow) arms [to the](https://www.youtube.com/c/IAmShow/featured) firm - all of which harbour similar content. I usually dislike the term "content", but it is exceedingly applicable here. Even their [social media presence](https://www.instagram.com/theinfographicsshow/?hl=en) is a venue for reams of this cookie cutter shit. The comments left on "wikitubia" illuminate little, but one indicates the use of a strange piece of cloud-software, ["animaker"](https://www.animaker.com/), that really takes them down a peg in my eyes. I thought the visual producers at least had a crazy work ethic - but this is awful. Now after some light searching, there's a suspect emerging as the man behind this clandestine operation, and apparently it's not his first.

Allegedly, the man behind it is called ["Andrej Preston"](https://www.behance.net/AndrejPreston). This guy, assuming we have the right one, is the [man (then-teen) behind mid 2000s piratebay contemporary "suprnova.org"](https://torrentfreak.com/suprnovaorg-two-years-since-the-shutdown/), which I'm sure I have visited in the ancient past, who tried to use the site's success - [even the source of its success](https://gigaom.com/2011/05/14/suprnova-torrent-site-web-video/) - to move into a more above-board world of web video and content. In lieu of this, the domain "supronova.org" is [eventually repurposed, as evidenced by the wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20160321054050/http://suprnova.org/), into a one stop shop for infographics.

Despite all that has now been uncovered, there's still an air of eerie artificiality. An interesting excursion nonetheless?

### Aftermarket // [Aftermarket](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aftermarket)

![Linux on the Sony](/assets/img/ps2linux.jpg)

Here's a free one. Listening to some videos about Linux on Playstation 2 - an interesting and [very much official](https://archiveos.org/linux-for-ps2/) thing in 2002 - the word "aftermarket" kept coming up. It is an interesting word, at least as far as I perceive it compared to its typical meaning. Now that I am typing about this and checking a dictionary it seems way less interesting and my endeavour to up my word count for little thought-cost is laid bare. Regardless, I've heard the word mostly in the context of automobiles and engineering/machinery, and thats [where we can find it](https://www.edmunds.com/car-maintenance/aftermarket-versus-manufacturer-car-parts.html) used plainly. Where I always imagined "aftermarket" to mean basically black-market, whether it's unofficial or hacked together things, it's pretty literal in meaning - literally "after the market" i.e. regarding extras/replacements/modification to be served after an official purchase of the original, where large enough to necessitate such a thing, product. 

![Aftermarket Cars](/assets/img/2f2f.png)

The issue here is where any official accessory/replacement fits in. Would a replacement screen from the company that manufactures the original device be aftermarket? Or are you then returning to the original market? The phrase "OE" or "OEM" (Original Equipment +- Manufacturer), where manufacturer would mean procured directly from an external manufacturer that provides/provided the parts to the original company, gets thrown around for this. Thus "aftermarket" sits in a value of grey somewhere between that and jury-rigging.

> Designed to be fitted to cars as a cheap substitute for OE parts, these might also be called replacement or pattern parts. This is because aftermarket companies frequently buy the rights to manufacture them using the template (pattern) from the original manufacturer.

This [post on this website](https://blog.greenflag.com/2017/spare-parts-what-is-the-difference-between-genuine-oem-aftermarket-and-used/) (inline linked) clarifies this whole situation a lot. They will not only back me up in my right to be confused by the terminology, but also differentiate further in the free real estate the confusion is generating. Of course being an auto site, the narrow scope misses some more interesting facets to the "aftermarket" and OEM system. For instance investopedia reframes the paradigm, denoting what in the former would be OE (no M) as "Value Added Resellers" of integrated OEM products. There's also something to be said for ["install base opportunism"](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/kodak.pdf), where the original product is sold, potentially at a loss, but the gains coming after the initial sale via strictly "OE/M" supplied replacement parts and so on (e.g. printer ink). I think this might be the most dull entry in a blog post yet.
